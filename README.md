# Loading Comments via GET AJAX

## Summary

Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (AJAX) is a set of technologies used to exchange data with a server without a page refresh, giving users a seamless browsing experience. This video covers the process of using AJAX to send an asynchronous web request in a Rails application to retrieve data in the form of comments on a post in a blog domain.

## Objectives

1. Use the `.on()` event handler function and `event.preventDefault()` to hijack the click event of an HTML anchor element.
2. Use the jQuery AJAX methods `.ajax()` or `.get()` within an event handler function to retrieve data from the server in the form of HTML, JSON, or JavaScript.
3. Conditionally render a Rails view from within a Rails controller action based on the data type of the server response.
4. Use jQuery DOM manipulation methods to place data returned by AJAX from the server into the DOM.
5. Understand that adding the `:remote => true` Rails helper to a link automatically creates an event that fires an AJAX request to the server when clicked.
